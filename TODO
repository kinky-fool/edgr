- move everything into a program called 'edgr' that takes cli args to do various modes
  - --checkimage - check a provided image filename
  - --partybus - slideshow and edging
  - --purge - purge porn pics slideshow
  - --status
    - show time remaining and edges required (if allowed)
  - --beater - metronome beat, cli
    - add edging ability for beater, maybe --sportscar? lol

- clean up code-base
  - remove unused scripts
  - remove 'organize' directory
  - create libraries / classes

- create a slideshow-less edgr option (CLI)
  - add option to have edges reduce required stroke time

- set up 2 modes w/ flags for edging mode or chill stroke mode

- green light options
  - green when all requirements met (stroke time, edges)
  - green when one requirement is met
  - green when X requirements met, when 2+ possible requirements

- concept of 'contracts', track:
  - initial edges
  - initial time
  - earned edges
  - earned time
  - owed edges
  - owed time
  - settings for edgr-beater

- edgr-beater should be the main app
- edgr-partybus will be the slideshow version

OLDER TODOS

- Add sqlite back-end for edge-for-me toy
- Figure out how to do maths / stddev and the like in python
- Figure out how to take my fuzzy algorithim from thong-game(? n = 5, for 1-n,
  take n and add or subtract 1. roughly... results in 0-10 mostly on 5... other
  bits were twiddled in other code to make it "favor" high or low.)
- Use the fuzzy algorithm to determine pre-edge duration, and edge prep phases
- Use "bonus" and "malus" integers from command-line to affect number of edges,
  threshold for being 'too late', number of edges added for being too late,
etc.
- ^ the idea here is "thong game" results in a stat, correct guesses in a row,
  incorrect guesses in a row, and i often use those to affect punishment
  severity - other bonus/malus values could be used, rolled dice, competitive
  game scores, wagers, etc.
- it could be interesting if there was a possibility for the toy(s) to give me
  'surprise' green lights, perhaps by curling a website or a post from twitter,
  or whatever.
- triggers via twitter could be cool; pre-defined #hashtags that the toy could
  search twitter for to influence what it instructs...
- website for managing these things, and seeing my statuses?

- audio cue script example:
  'lucky you, get some icy hot ready.' (wait for input)
  'start stroking' (pause X time)
  'stroke faster' (pause X time)
  'stroke faster' (pause)
  'stroke slower' (pause)
  'hands off your cock' (pause)
  'continue stroking, use some icy hot' (pause)
  'stroke slower' (pause)
  'use more icy hot' (pause)
  'hands off your cock' (pause)
  'get ready' (pause)
  'stroke for me, get to the edge' (pause) - (wait for input)
  'edge for me' (pause)
  'hurry, get to the edge' (pause)
  <laughter at taking too long> (pause)
  [receive input] 'too slow, try again' (pause)
  'stop stroking' (pause)
  'stroke yourself to the edge' (pause) - (wait for input)
  'hurry up!' (pause)
  [receive input] 'good boy, take a break' (pause)
  ... repeat, etc.
  countdown from 3; '3' ... '2' ... '1 and a half...' 'one and one quarter' 'one' ...
  'heads or tails?' (wait on input)
  [receive input] 'awwww, hands off your cock.' OR
  [receive input] 'lucky! cum for me!' (pause, wait on input)
  'hurry up!'
  'awwww, hands off your cock.' OR
  [receive input in time]
  'good boy, clean up your mess.'
