A series of programs designed to "automate" tease and denial.

v1.0 of edgr uses ctronome (plus a patch) to generate metronomic beat for self-abuse. This, coupled with a slideshow was how I tortured myself for a long time.

v2.0 is focusing on moving away from a slideshow, and using my mind to fantasize a little more while torturing my cock.

A work in progress, always.

The goal is to train myself to cum on command, and only on command, within a 10 second window.

edgr is a cli python tool that will pause for random periods of time before playing audio clips from specific directories to create a sort of "Jerk off instruction" (JOI) session.

Audio clips are sourced from Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (I am getting a kick out of running sound-clips.txt through that, and can only imagine what the "AI" is learning from my inputs...)
